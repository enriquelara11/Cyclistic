# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-share Analysis
Cyclistic is a Chicago-based bike sharing company. The firm operates a bike-sharing program with about 5,800 bikes and 600 docking stations located across the city. Cyclistic makes bike-sharing more accessible to those with disabilities by providing reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes. The comapny started a successful bike-sahring service in 2016 and since then, the firm has grown to over 5200 bicycles that are geotracked and linked to a network of over 620 stations across Chicago. So far the company has relied on building general awareness and appealing to customer segments. Pricing flexibility has been a corner stone of the companys success, having options for single-day passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Our driector of Marketing believes that annual memberships will be the key to growth moving forward. 

### Our Business Task
Identify the difference between our casual and annual riders. We'll be on the lookout for patterns and clues as to what distinguishes the two groups. We will give recommendations based on our findings on how to raise the number of annual members. Our marketing staff will then be informed of our results.
